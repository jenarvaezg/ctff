Starting to play around with GO. Only 1 form form, "register" but it does nothing yet. Now I know how to get sha512 in golang :)

Added a button to root page which redirects to the create_account form. Added CSRF token (yet to verify with cookie). For the sql driver ran `go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`
TODO: run mysql as normal user (maybe it is like that already)
TODO: create table

2015.11.14
